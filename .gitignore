# Note: We usually keep android/ios folders in RN if we ejected, but for Expo managed workflow we often ignore them unless we prebuild. 
# Since this is Expo managed, we can ignore them to keep repo light, OR keep them if prebuild was run. 
# Given the user ran 'npx expo install', it's likely managed. Let's ignore generated native folders if they exist to avoid clutter unless intended.
# However, standard expo gitignore often keeps them if you run prebuild. Let's stick to standard.
